Question: Georgie is a varsity player on a football team. He can run 40 yards within 5 seconds. If he can improve his speed by forty percent, how many yards will he be able to run within 10 seconds?
Let's think step by step
The additional yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 x 40/100 = 16 yards.
So the total yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 + 16 = 56 yards in 5 seconds.
Therefore the total yards he will be able to run to within 10 seconds is 56 x 2 = 112.
The answer is 112

Question: Hana sold 4/7 of her stamp collection for $28. How much would she have earned from selling the entire collection?
Let's think step by step
Hana sold 4/7 of her collection for $28, so 1/7 of her collection represents: 28/4 = $7.
And as a result, the entire collection represents: 7 * 7 = $49.
The answer is 49

Question: A shoe company sells $4000 worth of shoes every month. If they want to make $60000 in an entire year how many more dollars per month should they make selling shoes?
Let's think step by step
The amount of money they currently make in a year is 12 * 4000 = $48000.
The additional amount they need to make is $60000 - $48000= $12000 per year.
So, they should make $12000 / 12 = $1000 more every month.
The answer is 1000

Question: Olga has an aquarium with fish in 5 different colors. There are 12 yellow ones, half as many blue ones, and twice as many green ones as yellow ones. How many fish does Olga have in her aquarium?
Let's think step by step
Olga has half as many blue fish as yellow ones, which means 12 * 0.5 = 6 blue fish.
Green fish are twice as many as yellow ones, so in total there are 12 * 2 = 24 green fish.
So all the fish sum up to 12 + 6 + 24 = 42.
The answer is 42

Question: Every time Carl earned $0.50 he would go to the corner market and buy a candy bar.  Carl's neighbor said he would pay him $0.75 every week for taking out his trash.  At the end of four weeks, how many candy bars will Carl be able to buy?
Let's think step by step
He is paid $0.75 every week for 4 weeks, so Carl made .75 * 4 = $3.00 in 4 weeks
Each candy bar cost $0.50 and he made $3.00 so 3.00/.50 = 6 candy bars
The answer is 6

Question: Oranges have 80 calories and cost $1.20 each. If Timmy has $10 and needs to make sure he gets 400 calories, how much money will he have left after he buys the oranges he needs?
Let's think step by step
He needs to buy 5 oranges because 400 / 80 = 5
These will cost $6 because 5 x 1.2 = 6
He will have $4 left because 10 - 6 = 4
The answer is 4

Question: A school does a yearly tree planting activity. This year, the 4th graders planted a total of 30 trees while 5th graders planted twice as many. The 6th graders planted 30 fewer than thrice the number of trees planted by the 5th graders. How many trees did they plant altogether?
Let's think step by step
The 5th graders planted 30 x 2 = 60 trees.
Thrice the number of trees planted by the 5th graders is 60 x 3 = 180.
So, the 6th graders planted 180 - 30 = 150 trees.
Therefore, they planted a total of 30 + 60 + 150 = 240 trees.
The answer is 240

Question: Jonah decided to set up an aquarium. He started with 14 small fish. He added 2 more, but they ate 6 of his original fish before he could remove them and take them back to the store. He exchanged them for 3 new fish. How many fish does Jonah have now?
Let's think step by step
Jonah started with 14 fish + 2 more = 16 fish.
Of the 16 fish – 6 were eaten – 2 were returned to the store = 8 fish.
After he returned the fish to the store, he exchanged them for 3 new fish + 8 fish that were left = 11 fish now in his tank.
The answer is 11
