Question: Ivan has a bird feeder in his yard that holds two cups of birdseed. Every week, he has to refill the emptied feeder. Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan’s bird feeder feed weekly?
Let's think step by step
The squirrel steals 1/2 cup of birdseed every week, so the birds eat 2 - 1/2 = 1 1/2 cups of birdseed.
Each cup feeds 14 birds, so Ivan’s bird feeder feeds 14 * 1 1/2 = 21 birds weekly.
The answer is 21

Question: Samuel took 30 minutes to finish his homework while Sarah took 1.3 hours to finish it. How many minutes faster did Samuel finish his homework than Sarah?
Let's think step by step
Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then 1.3 hours is equal to 1.3 x 60 = 78 minutes.
Thus, Samuel is 78 – 30 = 48 minutes faster than Sarah.
The answer is 48

Question: Julia bought 3 packs of red balls, 10 packs of yellow balls, and 8 packs of green balls. There were 19 balls in each package. How many balls did Julie buy in all?

Question: Lexi wants to run a total of three and one-fourth miles. One lap on a particular outdoor track measures a quarter of a mile around. How many complete laps must she run?
Let's think step by step
There are 3/ 1/4 = 12 one-fourth miles in 3 miles.
So, Lexi will have to run 12 (from 3 miles) + 1 (from 1/4 mile) = 13 complete laps.
The answer is 13

Question: Asia bought a homecoming dress on sale for $140. It was originally priced at $350. What percentage off did she get at the sale?
Let's think step by step
Asia saved $350 - $140 = $210 on the dress.
That means she saved $210 / $350 = 0.60 or 60% off on the dress.
The answer is 60

Let's think step by step
She has 24 students and her muffin recipe only makes 6 muffins so she needs to bake 24/6 = 4 batches of muffins

Let's think step by step
the minimum is 5 more than 100 so 100+5=105
the maximum weight of a robot is twice the minimum 105*2=210
The answer is 210
